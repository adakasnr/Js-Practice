data types
undefined-- not defined yet 
null--nothing 
boolean--true or false
string--text written in single or double qoutes or back ticks
symbol 
number--that is a number
object--it can store lots of key values pairs

we keep data into a variable 
variable allows a computer to store and maniplate data
to declare variable we use key wards those are var,let and const
let- is only be used within scope of where we declared  
var- is a global one we can use that variable in entire code
const- is not changable(we can not change that variable value)
       if we declare a variable with the const keyward we can not reassign it afterwards 

let & const are using since ES6 2015
declaring variables and assigning variables is different 

we can not declare same variable by two times in the scope
 
console.log allows us to see things in the console 

use strict -it enables strict mode which catches common mistakes and unsafe actions,
            everyOne uses "use Strict" at top of a full javascript of in a function to catch coding mistakes,such as if we create a variable and do not declare it with var,let or const 

major differnce b/w var & let keyWords
var-> when we declare a variable with var it is declared globally or locally if declared inside a function             
let-> the scope of let is limited to the block statement or expression that it was declared in.
