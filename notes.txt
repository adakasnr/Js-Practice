data types
undefined-- not defined yet 
null--nothing 
boolean--true or false
string--text written in single or double qoutes
symbol 
number--that is a number
object--it can store lots of key values pairs

we keep data into a variable 
variable allows a computer to store and maniplate data
to declare variable we use key wards those are var,let and const
let- is only be used within scope of where we declared  
var- is a global one we can use that variable in entire code
const- is not changable(we can not change that variable value) 

declaring variables and assigning variables is different 

console.log allows us to see things in the console
