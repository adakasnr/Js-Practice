2.What are data types in javascript? what are primitive data types?

a data type determines the type of values that can be stored in a variable.
Primitive Data Types=>
                     Number
                     Strings
                     Booloean
                     Null
                     Undefined
Primitve Data Types are immutable, which means that thier vlues can not be changed or modified once they are created
Example
let age = 25; 
age = 30;
            In the memory 25 value stored and assigned to age variable, this memory is managed by the javascriot engine which by default comes with the browser, when we assign another value 30 to the age variable then a 30 will be stored as at a new location in the memory, basically we are not modifying the value of first location and converting it from 25 to 30 but we are creating a new value here in case of all primitive data types          

Non-Primitive Data Types=>
                     Objects
                     Array
                     Funtion
                     Date
                     RegExp

3.What is the difference b/w primitive and non primitive data types?

Primitive Data Types=>                          Non-Primitive Data Types=>
1.It can hold only single value                   1.It can hold multiple values and methods
2.These are immutable and their values can not    2.These are mutable and thier values can be 
be changed                                          changed
3.These are simple                                3.These are complex

If we update values in non-primitive data types, in the memory the value will be updated and modified no new memory place will be created for new value

 4.What are arrays,functons and object?
Array
an array is used to store a collection of values, such as a list of numbers or a list of names,with the help of index we can access any item or element and also we can make changes to the array with array methods

Functions
funtion is a block of code that performs a specific task or retuns a value.A function may or may not return a value 

Object
we can hold multiple values or a combination of values,we can assigin an array to the property of object and even we can assigin the funtion

/*
5.What is scope in javascript?
Local Scope 
Variables declared inside a function have local scope, which means they can be accessesd within the function not outside
Global Scope
Variables declared outside any function have global scope, which means they can be accessed from anywhere within a program
